* There are only two types of PRs are accepted in this blog:
    * `feature/blahblah`: adding some technical features to this blog.
    * `post/blahblah`: adding blog posts --> these are the most important PRs.

* `post` PRs need to be reviewed carefully before pushing. 
    * Please review English NLP, grammar, typos, .etc.

* Since there would be no technical errors, please mere `post` directly to `main` branch.

* After setting a sufficient Jekyll site, there will be no `feature` PRs, and only `post` PRs are merged.
