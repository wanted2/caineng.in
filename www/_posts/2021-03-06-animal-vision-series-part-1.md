The purpose of this `learning-by-doing` course is to get familiar with a cross-discipline topic: Computer Vision for Agriculture.
Specificially, we will introduce Animal Vision (AniV), targeting on canine animals.
Learners will get through several useful applications of Computer Vision (CV) into Animal Farming:

* Object Recognition, Detection and Segmentation (including class, instance and panoptic segmentation)
* Methods to adapt to new domains in farming such as Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation.
* Image enhancement methods such as de-raining, super-resolution, .etc.
* Applications such as Dog counting, animal crowd density estimation, anomaly detection.
