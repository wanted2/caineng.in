In the winter of 20xx, a professor was asked to evaluate a postdoc profile for hiring.
The offer is about 4.2 million per year (currency is not revealed).
An average postdoc lifetime is about 5 years (and then moving towards tenure or perish).
The inflation rate is about 3% per year.
The sponsors of the professor's project can give 50 million for five years.
__What is the hurdle rate__ that makes the profile (together with the project) is acceptable?
