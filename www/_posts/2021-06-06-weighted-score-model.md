In an attempt to overcome some of the disadvantages of profitability models, with one example, the [Discounted Cash Flow](/pm/2021/06/01/discounted-cash-flow.html) we have discussed last time, which particularly their focus on a single decision criterion, a number of evaluation/selection models that use **multiple criteria** to evaluate a project has been developed. 
Such models vary widely in their complexity and information requirements.
**Weighted Factor Scoring Model** is such one flexible method we discuss today.

## Weighted Score Model (WSM)

## Problem and Discussion

Use a weighted score model to choose between three methods $(A, B, C)$ of financing the acquisition of a major competitor.

A score of 1 represents unfavorable, 2 satisfactory, and 3 favorable.
