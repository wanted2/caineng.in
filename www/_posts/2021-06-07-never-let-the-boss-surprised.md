A prime law in projects is that _"Never Let The Boss Be Surprised!"_.
As such a phrase, team members are expected to be honest to the Project Manager (PM), and the PM is also expected to be honest to the senior managers in a parent organization.
Never hide the failures nor the risks from the PM!

## Introduction
At the beginning of a project, the PM must select the best personnel for the team by cooperating with the functional managers.
Besides personal characteristics such as _technical skills, political sensitivity, problem or goal orientation_, another aspect which is often expected to be seen in the team member is __high self-esteem__.
That translates into Japanese as "自尊心", or into Vietnamese as "lòng tự tôn".

In practice, there are two signs of lack of self-esteem:

* The members fear their own errors and try to hide the failures from the eyes of the PM. They are threatened by their own mistakes, though everyone can have mistakes!

* The members try to point out the mistakes of others. They try to take advantage of others' failures and cover their own.

__A man who is high self-esteem will never hide his own badness nor laugh at other mistakes. He will face his own failures as the challenges and help others to improve.__
