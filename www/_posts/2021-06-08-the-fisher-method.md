Conciliating the conflicts with allies is an important step to maintain a good alliance.
Key persons in the organization may be stubborn, especially the functional managers.
When both the functional managers and the project managers are technical people, cooperation between them often results in conflicts.
Fisher's method (1983, [3]) is a simple but yet effective way, often named by the "principled negotiation" or win-win method, applying in situations where allies disagree in some aspects of the project.

## Attack the problem, not the person
Separating the people from the issues allows the parties to address the issues without damaging their relationship. 
It also helps them to get a clearer view of the substantive problem.
Three sources of problems in parties involved in negotiation:

* **The multi-view problem**: each party has its viewpoints, with different perceptions of the facts.
The parties should not simply assume that their worst fears become the actions of the other party.
Nor should one side blame the other for the problem.
One should put itself in the stand of others.

* **The emotion problem**: Getting the task done is a frustrating process, sometimes.
When their interest is threatened, people often react with fear or anger.
When seeing a man with anger expression, we may dismiss the man's feeling, but it is likely to provoke more intense emotional responses.
Dealing with emotions requires a calm mind.
Symbolic gestures such as apologies or an expression of sympathy can help to defuse strong emotions.


* **The communication problem**: A party may not listen to what another one's speaking.
The listeners should pay full attention to the speakers.
However, misunderstanding can happen even the listeners hear carefully.

Dealing carefully with these issues may start by preventing them from arising.
Allies should think about their counterparts as partners, not as adversaries.
