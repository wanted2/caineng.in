Conciliating the conflicts with allies is an important step to maintain a good alliance.
Key persons in the organization may be stubborn, especially the functional managers.
When both the functional managers and the project managers are technical people, cooperation between them often results in conflicts.
Fisher's method (1983, [3]) is an effective way, often named by the "principled negotiation" or win-win method, applying in situations where allies disagree in some aspects of the project.

## Deal with the problem, not with the person
Separating the people from the issues allows the parties to address the issues without damaging their relationship. 
It also helps them to get a clearer view of the substantive problem.
Three sources of problems in parties involved in negotiation:

* **The multi-view problem**: each party has its viewpoints, with different perceptions of the facts.
The parties should not assume that their worst confusions become the actions of the other party.
Nor should one side blame the other for the problem.
One should put itself in the stand of others.

* **The emotion problem**: Getting the task done is a frustrating process, sometimes.
When their interest is threatened, people often react with confusion or anger.
When seeing a man with anger expression, we may dismiss the man's feeling, but it is likely to provoke more intense emotional responses.
Dealing with emotions requires a calm mind.
Symbolic gestures such as apologies or an expression of sympathy can help to defuse strong emotions.


* **The communication problem**: A party may not listen to what another one's speaking.
The listeners should pay full attention to the speakers.
However, misunderstanding can happen even the listeners hear carefully.

Dealing carefully with these issues may start by preventing them from arising.
Allies should think about their counterparts as partners, not as adversaries.


## Focus on the interest, not the positions

> Your position is something you have decided upon. 
> Your interests are what caused you to so decide.
> Fisher and Ury [3, p. 42]

Then interests are the root cause to solve the conflicts.
Fisher argued that negotiations must focus on such interests.
The first step is to identify the interests by asking the reasons for the positions to hold.
For example, when the PM asks the functional managers that _"We need to finish the task by June 25th"_, and the functional manager responds that _"We are busy until the end of June"_.
This conversation is no end without expected output.
The PM starts with a position way then the functional manager also ends with a position argument.
Removing the position may be like starting with _"Can we talk about the schedule?"_.
The scheduling problem touches on the mutual interests of PM and functional manager, and it works.
Once the parties have identified their interests, they must discuss them together and in a positive way.

## Generate more options for mutual gain

More options allow parties to achieve safer decisions.
However, there are 4 problems for multi-party scenarios to have mutual gain:

* Parties rely strongly on only one option and fail to consider alternatives.
* Parties have the intent to narrow the set of options to find limited answers.
* Parties have a bias on finding the options which bring advantages for them (bias on win-lose terms).
* Parties do not feel the responsibility to find the solution and decide to let others do so.

To generate meaningful options, parties should come together and brainstorm for creative proposals.
Evaluation should be separated and start from the most useful proposals.

## Use Objective Criteria

When interests come in opposing directions, using objective criteria bringing better resolution.
These criteria ground parties into the same standard and resolve the differences.
This leads to an agreement or a situation in which parties can agree.
Scientific findings, professional standards, or legal precedent are possible sources of objective criteria.
One way to test for objectivity is to ask if both sides would agree to be bound by those standards. 

> For example, children may fairly divide a piece of cake by having one child cut it, and the other choose their piece.

Some notes on using objective criteria:

* First, each issue should be approached as a shared search for objective criteria. 
* Second, each party must keep an open mind and reasonable.
* Third, while they should be reasonable, negotiators must never give in to pressure, threats, or bribes.
