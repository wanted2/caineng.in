Pure project organization emphasizes the role of project managers, while functional organization emphasizes the importance of functional departments such as accounting, finance, marketing, R&D, .etc.
Both have their own advantages and disadvantages.
The combination is the __Matrix Organization__ which takes the strengths of both predecessors in a "balanced" form between project managers and functional ones.

## The Matrix organizations
### Formation

<img src="/assets/img/matrix_org.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;" width="50%"/>
_Matrix Organization_ can be represented as tabular data, where each row for a PM and each column for a functional department.
The president directly manages the departments, and the PM deal directly with the clients.
PMs have flexibilities to handle the clients, while they also need to deal with the functional managers for many aspects of their projects: human resources, technology, resources, schedules, .etc.
_PMs decide where, when and what the project members achieve, but the functional managers select those people for the project and which technology is used in the project_.

Each cell represents the effort the PMs need to borrow from the departments for the aspects of their projects.
For example, PM1 needs a half man-month from the R&D department, but PM2 does not need to borrow effort from R&D.

### Advantages

Since its flexibility, PMs are the center of the organization while functional departments are the supporters.
Responses to the clients are rapid, and knowledge sharing among the organization and across projects/departments is possible.

### Disadvantages

First, it is the conflicts between PMs and functional managers when dealing with resources.
The workers always feel like they have two bosses, and that is another conflict.
Second, it is a myth about who is in charge of the project.
Since PMs control only people and tasks, functional managers control everything else like resources, schedules.
Third, people in these projects tend to resist the termination of the projects.
The first and second disadvantages often result in political fighting inside the organization.

## Imbalanced organizations
<img src="/assets/img/pure_org.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;" width="50%"/>
_Pure project organization_ is like its name, purely project-oriented.
Functional departments, if any, are just small offices, even with single members.
Since there is no functional department, each project must carry out responsibilities with all functional aspects such as budgets and costs (accounting), finance, technology, and everything else.
The project managers are then powerful in their projects.
They decide every aspect of the projects, deal directly with clients, and only report to the top management (president or the program managers).
Even if there are functional managers in the organizations, PMs do not care about them.
The pros include the freedom of each project and the PMs, less time spending on negotiating resources with functional departments.
But the disadvantages are also many.
Since each PM need to decide everything in the project, the burden is heavy.
Since each project is independent, less collaboration and knowledge sharing between projects is expected.
In short, PMs here are quite __soloers__.

Another imbalanced organization is the _Functional Organization_.
In this formation, it is usually no PM, and no project, of course.
The organization is of many departments, and there can be some internal projects in each department.
But as each department has its technical focus, projects that require collaborations across departments are rare.
Dealing with clients is slow because of the deep structure of management.
In other words, processes in this form are __slow__.



## Conclusion

Imbalanced options like pure project organizations and functional organizations are different extremes of the project spectrum.
The Matrix Organization (TMO) takes a more balanced form and comes with many strengths.
However, a source of conflicts is the political fighting between PMs and FMs, and the myth of finding who is actually in charge of the project should care are problems.
Pure project options may fit more small companies like startups, while functional ones fit big organizations like universities and corporations.
TMO is the middle and fits mid-size ventures.
