Tracking the information flow throughout the project is required for planning the coordinating flows.
Traditional tools like the Gantt chart are good at tracking the interdependencies between executions of concurrent tasks but fail to describe the causal dependencies between flows.
This problem is magnified when multidisciplinary teams join the stage.
Hence, the problem becomes increasingly serious while handling many domains at once.
To cope with this issue, __Design Structure Matrix (DSM)__, __Domain Mapping Matrix (DMM)__, and __Multiple Domain Matrix (MDM)__ have been proposed.
While DSM tracks the information flows, DMM can be used to show the person-task assignments.
MDM combines both DSM and MDM in multiple domains, i. e., coordinations of not only tasks but also people.
It can track all structures of the team, tasks, and assignments at once.
