Different roles in a project can have different perceptions about cost.
Commitments, expenses, and the organization's cash flows are vital to consider about the cost.
Losses incurred in the projects include finance expenses and taxes, too.
Project managers can use their understanding of these perceptions to impact the cost of the project.
Deferring and delaying are techniques the PMs can use to enhance their contributions to improve project expenditures.

## Three perceptions of project cost

<img src="https://www.pmi.org/kasimage/e59fca7f-56e2-45da-9597-ba50d908d786/J86JUN51-3.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;" width="50%"/>

Each key person in a project cares about different aspects of cost.
To the project managers, __commitments__ must be high to prove efficiency.
However, accountants implemented their accounting systems that do not identify commitments.
Accountants care more about __expenses__ for labor cost, materials, and equipment.
Senior and top managers care more about the __cash outflows__ of the organization.
If the project does not terminate on time, another tax period may start, and more money for taxes must be spent.

__Usually, a project should reduce all these factors, but the relationships of these costs often take the form in this figure__.
Commitment leads, cash outflow lags, and expenses fall in the middle.

## The bill

A typical bill of the project (profit and loss terms) is as follows.

| --- | --- |
|__Revenue (project sell price)__| __+\$1,000,000__|
|Cost of goods sold (project costs) | -\$750,000|
|__Gross-margin__| __+\$ 250,000__ |
|Selling, general & administrative expenses|-\$180,000|
|__Profit before interest and taxes__ |__+\$ 70,000__|
|Financial expense |-\$ 30,000|
|__Profit before taxes__ | __+\$ 40,000__|
|Taxes | -\$ 20,000|
|__Net profit__ |__+\$ 20,000__|

### Project cost (cost of goods sold)

In the examplar bill, they sold the project at 1M dollars, but the actual cost of goods sold was about 75% of the selling price.
Then the gross -margin (includes sales/GA costs, financial expenses, and taxes) was about \$250,000.
The net profit after tax was 20,000 dollars.
While the cost for Sales and GA is almost fixed in many companies, the cost of goods sold can be reduced by the actions of PMs.
An effective PM can reduce it by carefully making the choices:

* Considering __alternatives__ for design concepts and taking "trade-offs" can reduce the cost.
* __QA is expensive__: QA or any safety factors can enhance the quality but also makes the product more expensive.
Then PMs must be careful when thinking about doing __excessive QA__ in their projects.
Usually, after having safety at standard, it is possible to stop doing QA to prevent the cost go higher.
* **Control execution**: developers and technicians can require excessive time for development and testing.
This only increases the cost of the project.
PMs must control the cost of development by setting deadlines for any tasks and tests.
* **Cost of changes**: changes are often in projects.
The PMs must be aware of the contingency budget.
Unexpected problems ultimately arise, at which time the funds are needed.
Uses of this budget to finance a scope change is neither advantageous to the project manager nor to management.
* **Changes must be made under client or management approval**
* **Procurement of material, equipment, and services should be planned in the project schedule. The procurement that bases on incomplete requirements should be avoided.**
* **Economy phenomena like inflation can impact the project negatively**.
The PMs must handle such impacts effectively.

### Finance expenses and taxes

Finance expenses include the order placements during the project's life cycle, withheld funds, financial supports from vendors.
Internal projects may not experience outside pressures like client's payment considerations.
However, they live with the pressure to shorten the lifetime and to pay back faster to the organization.
In both cases, PMs need to care about delivering the outcomes faster to keep profits and reduce costs.
In other words, it always means to stop early.

Taxes are also another aspect for the top management to "kill" a project earlier.
Sometimes, it can be an order to reduce the lifetime to a half.
The reason behind the order can be the risk they feel about not meet a tax period deadline.
In some cases, PMs can insist company's top managers by changing the schedule to shift benefits and expenses from a tax period to the next.


### Defer when possible but don't delay the termination

When thinking about the timing to place purchase orders, the PMs can use deferring techniques to avoid buying equipment and material when the price is high.
The execution of placing orders can be deferred until the price becomes low.
However, this technique comes with risks: if the price does not go lower or if the item goes unavailable, it becomes a backfire to the project.

Deferring order placements can be helpful, but delaying the termination of a project can be dangerous.
Many organizations expect a project finishes on time to meet a tax deadline.
Delaying the termination for only a few days can result in a new tax period starts, and lots of money will be spent.
__Indeed, a PM should insist the organization by shortening the lifetime of the project when it is possible and do not delay the end.__


## Conclusion

An effective project manager can help the organization reducing project costs, expenses, and cash outflows a lot by the techniques described in this article.
Financial expenses and taxes can be other factors for the top managers to shorten project lifetime.
PMs must be aware of these risks and use techniques like deferring and delaying at the right time to mitigate.
