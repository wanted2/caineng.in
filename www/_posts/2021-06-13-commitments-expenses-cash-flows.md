Different roles in a project can have different perceptions about cost.
Commitments, expenses, and the organization's cash flows are vital to consider about the cost.
Losses incurred in the projects include finance expenses and taxes, too.
Project managers can use their understanding of these perceptions to impact the cost of the project.
Deferring and delaying are techniques the PMs can use to enhance their contributions to improve project expenditures.

## Three perceptions of project cost

<img src="https://www.pmi.org/kasimage/e59fca7f-56e2-45da-9597-ba50d908d786/J86JUN51-3.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;" width="50%"/>

## The bill

A typical bill of the project (profit and loss terms) is as follows.

| --- | --- |
|__Revenue (project sell price)__| __+\$1,000,000__|
|Cost of goods sold (project costs) | -\$750,000|
|__Gross margin__| __+\$ 250,000__ |
|Selling, general & administrative expenses|-\$180,000|
|__Profit before interest and taxes__ |__+\$ 70,000__|
|Financial expense |-\$ 30,000|
|__Profit before taxes__ | __+\$ 40,000__|
|Taxes | -\$ 20,000|
|__Net profit__ |__+\$ 20,000__|
