## Introduction

### Gantt charts

### Critical Path Model and PERT analysis (three-point analysis)

### Microsoft Project

## Preparation

### Sample data

In this practice, we use the sample project WBS is from a typical software development project. The data can be downloaded from the following resource.

* Software development project WBS (from University of Ohio): [download](http://regents.ohio.gov/obrpmcop/forms/examples/ex_wbs_sd.doc)

The sample project consists of 6 phases:

* Phase 1: Requirements Definition
* Phase 2: Logical Design
* Phase 3: Physical Design
* Phase 4: Programming and Unit Testing
* Phase 5: System Testing
* Phase 6: Installation

For simplicity, we only take a subset for example:

```
1	Requirements Definition (Phase 1)
  1.01	Requirements funding
    1.01.01	Review project request
    1.01.02	Establish preliminary justification
    1.01.03	Fund Phase 1
    1.01.04	Prioritize project
    1.01.05	Establish project team

```
