## Oracle Crystal Ball

### Download trial version

Although a license of OCB costs nearly [$1,000](https://shop.oracle.com/apex/product?p1=oraclecrystalball&p2=&p3=&p4=&p5=&sc=ocom_crystalball), we experience the trial version.
Please visit [here](https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/crystalball/downloads.html#) and follow the instruction to download trial versions.
To see the download link, you may need to register for an Oracle account.
Oracle reviews your download request.
In my case, it took less than 24 hours.
