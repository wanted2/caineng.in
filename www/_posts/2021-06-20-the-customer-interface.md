__Risks__ are quite often in project management.
__Financial risk__ and __schedule risk__ are among the most common risks in the project.
One of the most popular situations is when __the technical content turns to be more complex than planned__.
It adds a delay to the completion of the projects.
In this post, we review one of the exemplar stories (cases) from the PM book of Meredith _et al._ [1, pp. 472], in which the unaddressed risks led to the loss for all sides in terms of costs and delays in schedules.

# The story

The whole story can be found in [1, pp. 472].
The __scene graph__ for this story is as follows.

![](/assets/img/CI01.png)
_The organization._
__SPIS personnel: RB=Reggie Brown, RR=Roger Robert, JD=Jacqueline Doyle, RC=Rus Clemons__.
RB is the site manager, RR and JD are contract managers, and RC is the Vice President.
__NLP personnel: RJ=Rick James, LM=Lou Mayhew, SS=Sly Simmons, SG=Stand Goodsen, BJ=Bill Jones, MC=Mel Carter__.
SG is the on-site personnel but is not in charge of contracts. LM is the PIC for contracts.

Here we brief the case: NLP ordered SPIS for an outage in 1989.
SPIS's site manager, RB speculated some delays, and it had become real.
RB reported to SG as the technical personnel of NLP and asked for changes in contracts to change it to pay-as-you-go.
__SG replied as OK, but the real person in charge of contract management, LM, didn't get any request!__

NLP had changed the procedures for purchasing from 1986, but SPIS and RB didn't know about that.
After the delays, bills were one million bucks higher than the original deal (500,000\$).

Key persons in NLP found that the price went higher without their notices due to the fact that SPIS reported to the wrong personnel (RB).
In fact, they must ask LM for changes in contracts.

SPIS and NLP arranged some meetings to resolve the issues, but finally, one thing to keep in mind is that NLP still has four outages remaining!
If SPIS cannot handle well this customer relationship, they may lose the 4 outages that worth more.

# Lessons

* __QA to the right person__: RB didn't ask LM although, LM is the true PIC for contract, not SG.

* __Know the decision maker__: LM and his boss is the right decision-maker, not SG.

* __Control the customer__: SPIS wasn't aware of changes in purchasing procedures of NLP.

* __Get money for work performed__: I think SPIS should have divided work into smaller units and get paid for each done.
In fact, they waited until everything of the big piece's done for purchasing.

* __Persevere__
