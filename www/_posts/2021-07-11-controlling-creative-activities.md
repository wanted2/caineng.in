__Creative Activities__ like research and development projects, design projects, and similar processes depend strongly on the creativity of individuals and teams.
Controlling such activities is quite sensitive: _creative activities involve a high degree of uncertainty, but tight controlling inhibits the creativity_.
Such a dilemma can be controlled by looking carefully at processes, payoff, and risk management.

# Process Review

## Process Review vs. Result Review
In creative activities, _processes are often more certain than the results_ (Meredith _et al._ [1]).
Therefore, controlling the processes is more realistic than controlling the outcomes.
In contrast, outsource projects often certain enough then PMs only need to care about the results, and processes are not reviewed in those projects.
The contract in an outsourcing request often takes the form:

> In outsourcing, we provided a given input and desired outputs. The deliverable should be a software module that transforms the input into the outputs, and __that's all__!

Yes, that's all, and any further requests can be filtered by the contract terms.
__However, creative projects don't have such certain requirements__.
The outcomes can be __undetermined or vaguely determined__.
Therefore, controlling creative activities often review the processes rather than the final deliverable: we know the process to produce the deliverables, but we cannot know what deliverables are at the contract time.

> Even when we know the methods, we don't know what the final results are.

## Phase-Gate Control

Because processes are more reliable to control in creative projects, there is a need to divide the process in these creative activities into measurable milestones.
Assessments at each milestone should care about the progress so far, the potential value that can be achieved in the next step, and the desirability to change the research designs.
That is the _phase-gate control_.


# Personnel Reassignment

For such an uncertain type of project, it is valuable to reassign people: productive personnel are kept, while the rest is reassigned to other projects or other organizations.
It is easy to perform this control, but there are several issues:

* If the favored personnel doesn't change, then there is a possibility to create an elite group: new personnel becomes demotivated when joining, while old personnel is already highly motivated for further achievements.

* It is difficult to rank middle quartiles.

# Control of Input Resources

Creativity does not equal the generosity of resources.
Resource controlling helps to enhance the efficiency of creative projects.
Outcomes in R&D projects often come in __batches__: sometimes, there are no visible results, but suddenly many outcomes can be delivered.
